// Package workflow provides the LLM system tools for the user's workflow library. Two groups:
// the BUILD/QUERY tools that edit the graph — search / get / create / edit / revert / delete /
// capability_check (build.go, query.go); and the EXECUTION-LIFECYCLE tools that drive its runtime —
// trigger / stage / activate / deactivate / kill (exec.go, D1, over the durable scheduler + trigger
// binder). All are lazy tools (Toolset.Lazy) — surfaced via search_tools, not resident.
//
// Package workflow 提供操作用户 workflow 库的 LLM system tool。两组：编辑图的 BUILD/QUERY 工具——
// search / get / create / edit / revert / delete / capability_check（build.go, query.go）；驱动其运行时的
// 执行生命周期工具——trigger / stage / activate / deactivate / kill（exec.go，D1，基于 durable 调度器 +
// trigger binder）。全是懒加载工具（Toolset.Lazy）——经 search_tools 浮现、非常驻。

const opsDoc = `OP SHAPES (each has an "op" discriminator):

      // concurrency = overlap policy when a fire arrives while a run is in flight: serial (queue the new one, run after the current), skip (drop the new one), buffer_one (queue but keep only the LATEST — older waiting fires are superseded), replace (gracefully cancel the in-flight run and run the new one instead), allow_all (run concurrently). Default serial.

NODE KINDS & REF PREFIXES: trigger→trg_, action→fn_ | hd_<id>.method | mcp:server/tool, agent→ag_, control→ctl_, approval→apf_.
A node's "input" wires each field to a bare CEL expression that reads UPSTREAM NODES' RESULTS BY NODE ID — "<upstreamNodeId>.<field>", e.g. "start.amount" or "check_amount.score". There is NO payload/ctx/input root in a node's input CEL; address the producing node directly. A trigger node has no input.
NODE RESULT SHAPES — what "<nodeId>.<field>" can read from each kind:
  • trigger  → the fire payload's fields (e.g. start.amount).
  • action   → a function's declared outputs / a handler method's return / an mcp tool's result.
  • control  → the chosen branch's emit fields (flattened) plus "__port" (the branch name taken).
  • approval → {decision: "yes"|"no", reason} ONLY — an approval does NOT pass its input through. To use the original data downstream (e.g. the amount), read it from an upstream node like "start.amount", NOT from the approval node.
  • agent    → if it declared "outputs", those structured fields; if "outputs" is empty (a free-form answer), a single field "text" — read as <nodeId>.text.
  ↳ SCHEMA-LESS result (ANY callable kind): a function / handler / mcp tool / agent that returns a bare string|number|array — NOT an object — lands under ONE field "text"; read it as <nodeId>.text (e.g. a schema-less summarizer agent → summarize.text, an mcp text tool → echo.text). capability_check cannot see this key (no declared schema), so wire it from this doc — not by trial-and-error on a failed run.
fromPort is required on an edge leaving a control node (a branch name) or an approval node (yes|no), and must be absent otherwise.
The graph must have ≥1 trigger, no orphan nodes, and any loop must be closed by a control or approval branch (a back edge).
LOOP STATE: a back edge re-runs the downstream nodes each iteration; a node reads its loop-internal predecessor's result, which on iteration N≥1 is the PRIOR turn's value. On the FIRST turn that predecessor has not run yet, so to carry/accumulate state you MUST guard the read: "has(loopNode.field) ? loopNode.field : seedNode.field" — initialise from a pre-loop node on turn 1, then accumulate from the loop node after. Carry the state forward on the back edge via the control's emit (e.g. a control whose emit is {count: input.count + 1}, with a downstream node reading "has(theControl.count) ? theControl.count : start.count"). A bare unguarded read of a not-yet-run loop node fails on turn 1; guard it with has().`
